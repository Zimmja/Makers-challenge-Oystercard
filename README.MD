# Oystercard Challenge

As part of the Week 2 challenges at Makers Academy, we were given a task that emphasised the construction of a class-oriented program, working with Ruby, TDD, use of mocks in testing and an object-oriented design. Over the course of this week, I worked with several people's Git repositories before pushing the last repo I worked on to my own GitHub profile.

### Challenges 1 - 9

These challenges were completed with **Adam Harbisher**.

#### Challenges 1 - 3: setting up the project
We began by reviewing some of the more basic elements of setting up a ruby project:
- Creating a Gemfile with relevant links
- Creating a testing suite, including an rspec
- Reviewing basic debugging practices

#### Challenge 4 - 7: creating a basic class
We began the project with a single class object in which we added functionality to mimic the behaviour of an Oystercard. At this stage, all programming was around changing the balance of money on the card:
- The ability to add a balance to the card
- Enabling top-ups to increase the balance
- Enforcing a maximum balance
- Deducting money on use

#### Challenges 8 and 9: creating new functionality
These challenges emphasised the addition of new functionality that built upon the existing functionality. This included:
- The ability to touch in/out of a station
- The ability to review a balance

### Challenges 10 and 11

These challenges were completed with **Monaliza Wohlers**.

Like challenge 8 and 9, these challenges involved building more functionality upon what we'd already created. To complete these challenges, we discussed several different ways to create the necessary functionality as it became increasingly complex. This was very useful as a means of exploring how different people approach the same problems, and for considering different ways of structing a project.

### Challenges 12 and 13

These challenges were completed with **Mark McLeod**.

For these challenges, Mark and I experimented with a stricter pair-programming format than I had used previously, with set, frequent breaks and an emphasis on providing feedback and switching roles regularly. This proved very helpful as the challenges got harder, with 12 and 13 requiring more advanced coding and the creation of a new class.

### Challenge 14

This challenge was completed with **Myoung Bae**.

This challenge required us to extract a new class from an existing class, and to consider edge cases and how best to protect against them while maintaining a TDD approach.

### Challenge 15

This challenge was completed with **Ryan Grimes**.

It was very similar to chellenge 14 in that our goal was to extract a class from an existing one. This proved very challenging and was made harder by issues in aligning Git repositories, but we were able to successfully complete the task with all rspec tests passing and with all necessary classes established. The final output of our work on this repository has been brought forward to this page.
